# odin-recipes
This is my first project following The Odin Project!
Using what I have learned about Visual Studio, command line functions, HTML, Git, and GitHub, I will build a simple recipe website.
This will be very rudimentary, but I am building a solid foundation before moving on to more complex projects.

I am excited for what the future has in store for me and I cannot wait to learn as I journey through this technology driven venture.
